Stored Procedure call stack in INFORMATION_SCHEMA
******************

**This is a MySQL feature request submitted as "bug report #36106":http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=36106.**


Having a call stack available in stored procedures would make debugging much much easier.
It could be a table like this:

/--code
----------------------------------------------
depth INT  routine_name VARCHAR   routine_type ENUM  started TIMESTAMP ...
1          nn_TeachXOR            PROCEDURE          128458937
2          nn_ComputeNet          PROCEDURE          128458938
3          nn_ComputeLevel        PROCEDURE          128458938
...
\--


With such table, one could do profiling,

/--code
SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP() - started AS duration
  FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CALLSTACK
  ORDER BY depth DESC LIMIT 1; 
\--

structured logging, e.g.:

/--code
INSERT INTO log
  SELECT CONCAT( REPEAT('  ', ), '+--  ', routine_name) AS str
  ORDER BY depth ASC;
\--

and more...
