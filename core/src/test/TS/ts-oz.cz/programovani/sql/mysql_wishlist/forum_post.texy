Feature request discussion: Result sets stored in @variables
************************************************************

Hello,

I got over several weeks of stored routines developement, and the most missed feature was a seamless mechanism for
 - calling routines with a resultset in a parameter,
 - retrieving a result set coming stored procedure,
 - and eventually, for keeping a resultset somewhere without need to create a table.

All of this would be possible if we could store a resultset in a variable.
So I have stated a feature request, not yet submitted to a buglist.
First I would like to know others' oppinions and suggestions, because I am not much familiar with other DBMS.

I guess that such functionality would not be easy to implement and is not likely to appear soon.
But it would be a giant leap for MySQL's stored procedures programming.


Here is a brief overview:

##  Create the result set and store it in a variable.
SELECT * FROM table1 INTO @resultset;
  -- or --
SET @resultset = (SELECT * FROM table1);

##  Pass the result set into a stored procedure.
CALL StoredProcedure( @resultset );

##  Retrieving a result set from a stored procedure
CALL StoredProcedure() INTO @result;
-- or --
SET @result = (CALL StoredProcedure());

Now - what do you think? Would this ease your SP developement? Is there some better concept?

Thanks for comments.
