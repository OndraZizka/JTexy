Java objects in Stored Procedures (sci-fi)
******************************************


The notice of having possibility to call Java from stored procedures
made me like looking forward to great future :-)
The best thing I can imagine now is that I could have Java object references 
in user variables, something like:

/--code
SET @jDate = java::new('java.util.Date');
SET @sDate = @jDate.toString();
\--

Or, letting my imagination fly far away:

/--code
SET @jWebService = java::jndi('java:comp/env/ws/weather');
SET @jResults = @jWebService.getWeatherIn('Brno');
SET @jResIter = @jResults.getIterator();
WHILE @jResIter.hasNext() DO
  SET @jRes = @jResIter.next();
  ...
END WHILE;

Concerning web services, there already is a solution:
UDF (user defined functions).
There are some already working, hopefully their authors will 
release their source some day.
