****************************************

Today I found "Sardine":http://code.google.com/p/sardine - a nice library 
which aims to be an easy-to-use Java tool to send WebDAV requests and process the replies.
I especially like the ellegant use of JAXB.

It's still under developement, so don't expect it to be production-ready
(e.g. "I found a deadlock":http://code.google.com/p/sardine/issues/detail?id=26 in a simple use case).
But "it's alive":http://code.google.com/p/sardine/source/list and hopefully some community will gather around it.

It's "not mavenized":http://code.google.com/p/sardine/issues/detail?id=1,
but I am going to create a maven artifacts time by time and publish them in the project's SVN.
