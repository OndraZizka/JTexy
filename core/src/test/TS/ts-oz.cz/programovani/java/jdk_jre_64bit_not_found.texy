Java Runtime Environment or Java Developement Kit not found on 64-bit system
****************************************

I have 64-bit version of Windows XP and 64-bit version of JDK and JRE.
 During instalation of jEdit, I got this message from the installer:

> Setup was unable to find an installed Java Runtime Environment or Java Developement Kit of version 1.4, or higher.
> You must have installed at least JDK or JRE 1.4 to continue setup.

jEdit installer looks for 32-bit version of JRE. Install it alongside the 64-bit version to fix the problem.

The same problem was with NetBeans installer.
