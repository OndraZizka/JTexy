#summary Optimizations that can be done if necessary.

= Possible Optimizations =

== Parsing ==

 * Parse loop: Don't scan all matches of all patterns; instead:
   * Find the first match of each pattern.
   * Then process the one at nearest position; that sets the offset after that block.
   * Then find the next match of those patterns whose nearest matches were in the processed block.

This should spare many regexp find() calls.
